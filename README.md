## üìå Project Overview
Industries face challenges in maintaining machinery efficiently due to unplanned downtime, leading to increased costs and reduced productivity. This project develops an **Automated Anomaly Detection System** using machine learning to predict potential failures in industrial machines. The system analyzes sensor data and detects anomalies, enabling predictive maintenance to optimize maintenance schedules and enhance equipment lifespan.

## üìä Data Sources
- **Dataset Name:** AnomaData.xlsx
- **Size:** 18,000+ Rows, 60+ Columns
- **Features:** Machine sensor readings (environmental conditions, system parameters)
- **Target Variable:** `y` (Binary Classification: 1 = anomaly, 0 = normal)
- **Challenges:** Highly imbalanced dataset (minority class represents anomalies)

## üîç Data Preprocessing Steps
1. **Data Loading & Inspection:** Handling missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies.
2. **Outlier Detection & Removal:** Using IQR and Boxplots to eliminate extreme values.
3. **Feature Scaling:** Normalizing numerical features using StandardScaler.
